# Tree Structure Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### New Components Created

1. **TreeTaskItem.jsx** - A new component that properly renders tasks with tree structure
   - Handles proper indentation for subtasks
   - Shows tree branches (├─ for middle items, └─ for last items)
   - Maintains all the color coding and status symbols from the CLI
   - Properly aligns selection indicators with tree structure

2. **TreeTaskList.jsx** - Enhanced task list that flattens the task hierarchy
   - Transforms nested task structure into a flat list with depth information
   - Maintains proper windowing for performance
   - Correctly calculates item positions for navigation

### Key Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**
   - Parent tasks appear at the root level with ID, priority, and status
   - Subtasks are indented with tree branches showing their relationship
   - Last subtask in a group uses └─ while others use ├─
   - Subtask IDs show as "parentId.subtaskId" format

2. **Proper Alignment**
   - Selection indicator (>) aligns to the left margin
   - Tree branches are properly indented
   - All text elements align correctly regardless of selection state

3. **Example Output**
```
  ✓  1 H Setup project infrastructure
  ►  2 H Implement authentication
    ├─ ✓ 2.1 Design auth schema
    ├─ ► 2.2 Implement JWT tokens
    └─ ○ 2.3 Add OAuth providers
  ○  3 M Create API endpoints
    ├─ ○ 3.1 User CRUD operations
    └─ ○ 3.2 Product endpoints
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Parent-Child Relationships** - The tree structure makes it immediately obvious which subtasks belong to which parent tasks

2. **Improved Navigation** - Users can see the task hierarchy at a glance and navigate through it intuitively

3. **Consistent with CLI Tools** - The tree structure follows common terminal UI patterns (like `tree` command)

4. **Scalable Design** - The structure can handle multiple levels of nesting if needed in the future

## Usage

The new components are drop-in replacements for the previous TaskItem and TaskList components. The TaskListContainer has been updated to use TreeTaskList, which automatically handles the transformation of the task data into the proper tree structure.
