# Task ID: 96
# Title: Create Interactive Terminal Interface with Ink
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a terminal-based interactive interface for the task-master CLI using Ink (https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink). This interface should eventually replicate all current CLI functionalities in a more user-friendly, interactive way.
# Details:
The first feature to implement is the real-time display of task statuses. This will likely involve:
1. Fetching task data periodically or subscribing to updates.
2. Using Ink components like `<Box>`, `<Text>` to structure the UI.
3. Leveraging React hooks such as `useState` to manage the task list and their statuses, and `useEffect` to handle data fetching and real-time updates (similar to the Ink `Counter` example that updates on a timer).
4. The interface should dynamically rerender when task statuses change. Ink's `rerender` function or standard React state updates should facilitate this.

Key Ink documentation snippets to consider:
- Counter example for timed updates: `useEffect` with `setInterval` and `useState`.
- Component rendering and rerendering: `render()` and `rerender()`.
- Layout components: `<Box>`, `<Text>`.

Future enhancements will include adding, removing, updating tasks, and managing dependencies through this interface.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up basic Ink project structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure the Ink project with necessary dependencies for the task-master CLI interface
### Details:
Install Ink and related packages (npm install ink react @inkjs/ui). Create the basic project structure including the main app component, entry point file, and configuration for the CLI. Set up the build process using npm scripts to compile TypeScript/JSX to JavaScript. Ensure the CLI can be executed properly with a simple 'Hello World' test to verify the setup is working.

## 2. Implement task data fetching mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 96.1
### Description: Create a data service to fetch task information from the existing task-master system
### Details:
Develop a module that interfaces with the existing task-master data storage to retrieve task information. Implement functions to get all tasks, filter tasks by status, and subscribe to task updates. Use appropriate data structures to represent tasks with their properties (ID, title, status, etc.). This module should be independent of the UI components to maintain separation of concerns.

## 3. Design and implement the task display UI components [done]
### Dependencies: 96.1
### Description: Create React components using Ink to display task information in an organized layout
### Details:
Develop UI components using Ink's <Box>, <Text>, and other primitives to create a structured layout for displaying tasks. Create a TaskList component to render multiple tasks, and a TaskItem component for individual task display with appropriate styling based on status (e.g., completed tasks in green, overdue in red). Implement proper spacing and alignment using Flexbox properties supported by Ink's Yoga layout engine.

## 4. Implement real-time updates with React hooks [done]
### Dependencies: 96.2, 96.3
### Description: Use React hooks to manage state and implement real-time updates of task statuses
### Details:
Implement useState hooks to manage the task list state. Create useEffect hooks to handle periodic data fetching (using setInterval) or to subscribe to task updates. Ensure the UI rerenders when task data changes. Implement proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks when the application exits. Follow the Counter example from Ink documentation as a reference for implementing timed updates.

## 5. Create the main application component with navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 96.3, 96.4
### Description: Develop the main application component that integrates all UI elements and provides basic navigation
### Details:
Create the main App component that serves as the entry point for the CLI. Implement a simple navigation system using Ink's Select component from @inkjs/ui to allow users to switch between different views (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks). Handle user input using the useInput hook to navigate through tasks and perform basic actions. Ensure the application has a clean exit mechanism and proper error handling.

## 10. Test and Validate Interactive Task Status Display [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of the real-time task status display, including edge cases and performance under frequent updates.
### Details:
Test the interface with various task data scenarios, including rapid status changes and large task lists, to ensure reliability and responsiveness.
