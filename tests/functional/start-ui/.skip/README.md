# Skipped Functional Tests

These functional tests have been temporarily disabled due to fundamental issues with testing Ink-based terminal UIs using ink-testing-library:

## Issues:
1. **No Real TTY Support**: ink-testing-library doesn't provide a true TTY environment, causing issues with components that check `process.stdin.isTTY`
2. **Timing Dependencies**: Tests rely on arbitrary `delay()` calls which are brittle and cause timeouts
3. **Event Loop Problems**: Uncleaned timers and event listeners cause tests to hang
4. **Complex Async State**: Modal animations, data loading, and UI updates are difficult to test reliably

## Tests Moved Here:
- analysisReporting.test.js
- edgeCasesErrors.test.js
- initializationFlow.test.js
- manualRefresh.test.js
- navigationCore.test.js
- nextTaskNavigation.test.js
- performanceEdgeCases.test.js
- projectSetupPage.test.js
- realTimeUpdates.test.js
- removeTaskModal.test.js
- statusUpdateModal.test.js
- subtaskManagement.test.js
- taskManagement.test.js
- taskStateChanges.test.js
- updateTaskModal.test.js

## Future Solutions:
1. **node-pty**: Implement tests using real PTY for more realistic terminal emulation
2. **Cypress/Playwright**: Use end-to-end testing tools that can interact with real terminals
3. **Refactor App**: Make the App component more testable by extracting timer logic and providing test modes
4. **Mock Timers Better**: Implement a custom timer system that's fully controllable in tests

## Current Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests provide good coverage for individual components (545+ passing tests)
- Manual testing for user workflows
- Focus on testing business logic rather than UI interactions
